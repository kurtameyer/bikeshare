# bikeshare
This is a machine learning project I completed in class working with the Bike Share dataset from Kaggle. 

I started the project off with basic data exploration looking for missing data, determining categorical and numerical features, and visualizing the data. I also implemented a correlation matrix to find any interesting or hidden relationships among the different features. I then prepared the data by dropping specific columns which did not seem to be relevant and then split the data in to train, test, and split sets. I one-hot encoded the categorical features of the data and then implemented a Random Forest regressior, a decision tree regressor, and ridge/lassor regressors. 

Last I performed a cross validation search to tune the best model, which was the Random Forest regressor.
